 * Exercise 12.6 - ASSIGNMENT 9
 * 
 * CASE 1: You did not complete your World Map Assignment using Classes
 * 
 * 			PART 1: Output Streams
 * 					Write a program that takes your 2-D Arrays and WRITES them to text files 
 * 					called 00.txt, 01.txt, 02.txt, 10.txt, 11.txt, 12.txt, 20.txt, 21.txt, 
 * 					and 22.txt. You should use the exact Arrays you've defined in Assignment 6 as
 * 					input for your program.
 * 
 * 			PART 2: Input Streams
 * 					Convert your World Map Program so that instead of populating the Arrays within
 * 					your program, it instead reads the array lines from 00.txt, 01.txt, etc.
 * 					This allows you to edit your world by editing the text files directly. If you
 * 					feel it is easier to use a 3-D Array to achieve this, you may! (a 3-D Array works
 * 					exactly how it sounds - myArray[][][]).
 * 
 * 			EXTENSION: Create a "Map Builder" by allowing the user to specify a file name, and 
 * 					   type in a map line by line to the console, which will then be written to
 * 					   the specified text file.
 * 					   In your Map Builder, allow the user to print a specified text file name, and 
 * 					   edit the map by changing a particular line (Tricky).
 * 					   Make your Map Builder User-Friendly.
 * 
 * CASE 2: You completed your World Map Assignment using Classes or you finish the above very quickly and easily
 * 
 * 			MAKE A DATABASE
 * 
 * 			We will demonstrate your Knowledge of Input/OutputStreams in another way. Write a 
 * 			program to prompt the user, and have them enter a bunch of information, including:
 * 				- Name
 * 				- Age
 * 				- Period 1 Class
 * 				- Period 1 Teacher
 * 				- Period 2 Class
 * 				- Period 2 Teacher
 * 				- Period 3 Class
 * 				- Period 3 Teacher
 * 				- Period 4 Class
 * 				- Period 4 Teacher
 *  			- Period 5 Class
 *  			- Period 5 Teacher
 *  		Also allow the user to have the option of "Recalling" one of the entries in your line.
 *  
 *  		PART 1: Output Streams
 *  				Write each set of output to a new line, and give it an ID Number. For instance, 
 *  				the first time I run this program and enter my name, I would have something like 
 *  				the following line written to my text file (as an example):
 *  				
 *  				1) Mr.Parchimowicz 100000 ICS34C Mr.Parchimowicz Break NoOne ICS3U1 Mr.Parchimowicz Break NoOne ICS4U1 Mr.Parchimowicz
 *  	 	
 *  				"Append" this data to the file... do not destroy and recreate the file!
 *  				Note that for this purpose, we should use a BUFFERED WRITER BufferedWriter 
 *  				instead of PrintWriter. Give it a quick Google Search, the syntax is largely
 *  				similar.
 *  
 *  		PART 2: Input Streams
 *  				Prompt the user to enter a userID number (for instance, 1). Prompt them to 
 *  				indicate whether they wish to recall a specific piece of information (e.g. 
 *  				Period 3 class) or print everything about that user. Output this to the console
 *  				in some meaningful way.
 *  
 *  		EXTENSION: Allow the user to enter multiple entries at a time.
 *  				   Allow the user to delete a specified entry from the database.
 *  				   Improve the User-Friendliness and readability in some way
 *
