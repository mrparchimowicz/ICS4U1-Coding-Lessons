 * Exercise 5.8 - ASSIGNMENT 2
 * 
 * You now have enough knowledge to complete Assignment 2. You will need to use your knowledge of the Scanner class, conditional statements
 * and loops.
 * 
 * NOTE: A "Sentinel" value is a value that is not normally a possible value that provides a condition under which the While loop can 
 * terminate. For instance, you could use while(studentMark != -1) as students are not expected to get a mark of -1.
 * 
 * ==========ASSIGNMENT 2==========
 * 
 * In groups of 1-3 people, write a program to do the following:
 * •	Write a program to add up a student’s test marks and find an average.
 * •	The user should be prompted as to whether they know how many tests there will be in the semester.
 * •	If they do know the number of tests, use an appropriate loop structure to add up their test marks and calculate the average of the tests.
 * •	If they do not know the number of tests in a semester, use an appropriate loop structure to add up the test marks until a sentinel is reached, and then output the average of the tests entered.
 * •	If they respond with an invalid choice, give an error message.
 *	
 * EXTENSIONS:
 * 1)	Was your program written efficiently? Why or why not? If it wasn’t efficient, can you modify it to use fewer lines of code? 
 * 2)	Did you have any errors in your calculations? If so, what happened? Can you troubleshoot them and correct?
