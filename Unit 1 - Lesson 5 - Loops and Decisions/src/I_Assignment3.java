 * Exercise 5.9 - ASSIGNMENT 3
 * 
 * You now have enough knowledge to complete Assignment 3. You will need to use your knowledge of the Scanner class, conditional statements
 * and loops.
 * 
 * NOTE: A "Sentinel" value is a value that is not normally a possible value that provides a condition under which the While loop can 
 * terminate. For instance, you could use while(studentMark != -1) as students are not expected to get a mark of -1.
 * 
 * ==========ASSIGNMENT 3==========
 * 
 * In groups of 1-3 people, write a program to do the following:
 * •	Write a program that offers a user 3 options:
 * 		1)	To have the computer tell it a knock-knock joke
 * 		2)	To have the computer find the highest value of 3 integer numbers
 * 		3)	To have the computer calculate the roots of a quadratic given a, b and c.
 * •	You must include the 3 types of methods in your program. 
 * •	You must (at least sometimes) prompt the user for values outside of the methods so you can practice passing values as parameters
 * •	Create a loop so the user can continually choose one of these 3 options until they respond with a sentinel value
 *
