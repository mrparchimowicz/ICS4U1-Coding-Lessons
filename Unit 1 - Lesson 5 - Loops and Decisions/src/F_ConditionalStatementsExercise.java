 * Exercise 5.6 - REVIEW - LOGIN SCREEN
 * 
 * 
 * Task - Create a simple login screen that prompts the user for their Username and Password, and if they are 'correct' tell them they have 
 * logged in successfully, and if not, tell them that they are incorrect and to try again. 
 * 
 * This exercise is possible with some clever use of a For loop, but it's much easier with a 'while' loop. This is a simpler type of loop 
 * that does not have a counter. It can be controlled with any true/false condition (so think of making a boolean value to check if the 
 * condition is correct).
 * 
 * HINT - Remember, String is not a primitive data type so you will need to use the .Equals() (See Exercise 3.7).
 * 
 * BONUS - have more than one valid username/password combination
 * BONUS - if the user types Quit, have the program loop terminate (stop running).
