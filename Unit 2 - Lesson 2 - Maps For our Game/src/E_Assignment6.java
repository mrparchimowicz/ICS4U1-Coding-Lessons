 * Exercise 9.5 - ASSIGNMENT 6 - A WORLD MAP
 * 
 * Create a set of at least 9 map screens arranged in a 3x3 grid. You may follow my idea using 2-D arrays to 
 * accomplish this, or if you know any more sophisticated techniques feel free to use those.
 * 
 * Please include an ASCII "World map" of your world in the comments. Be sure to make your rooms a standard 
 * size (mine were 19 by 11, not including the border). The rooms do not need to be the same size as in the example,
 * but there should be some consistency within your own program.
