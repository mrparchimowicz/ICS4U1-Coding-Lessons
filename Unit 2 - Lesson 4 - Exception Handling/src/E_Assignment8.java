 * Exercise 11.5 - ASSIGNMENT 8 - EXCEPTION HANDLING FOR YOUR WORLD MAP
 * 
 * A nice quick one - go back to Assignment 6 (World Map). Add Exception Handling to your code via
 * a try-catch-finally statement.
 * 
 * You do not need to upload anything to Google Classroom. Simply call me over to check, and submit 
 * a 'blank' document (or nothing) to Google Classroom to help me keep track of who I have spoken
 * to.
 * 
 * If you've already implemented exception handling in that project, then that's fine - just call me
 * over to have a look and submit as above.
 *
