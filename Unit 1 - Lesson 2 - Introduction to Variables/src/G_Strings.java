 * Exercise 2.7 - STRINGS
 * 
 * Strings are variables that can hold several alphanumeric characters of text, such as a letter, word, phrase or sentence, or number which will not be used for calculations.
 * 
 * Strings are our first example of an "object" which is not a "primitive" (of the most basic type) variable. Strings are built out of several "Chars." 
 * 
 * Create a variable called openingLyrics that holds "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away".
 * 
 * Print out your variable.
