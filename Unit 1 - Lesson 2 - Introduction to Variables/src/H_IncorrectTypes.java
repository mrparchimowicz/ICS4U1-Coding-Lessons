 * Exercise 2.8 - INCORRECT TYPES
 * 
 * The Java programming language has "static typing." Java programs will not compile if a variable is assigned a value of an incorrect type. 
 * This is a bug, specifically a type declaration bug.
 * 
 * Try to run the code, and note what the error looks like when it has the wrong variable type.
 * 
 * Then for each variable, fix its variable declaration so that it is of the correct type.
