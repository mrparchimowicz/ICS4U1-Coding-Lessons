 * 
 * Exercise 8.9 - ASSIGNMENT 5 - MAKE YOUR OWN "CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE"
 * 
 * Please submit a .java file to Google Classroom with your solution.
 * 
 * Using Exercise 8.8 as an idea, create your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" program.
 * 
 * Make yours better than mine by incorporating the new ideas presented in Lesson 8, 
 * as well as any other skills or programming constructs you're familiar with that I 
 * haven't covered (e.g. lists, etc.)
 * 
 * Be sure to include a Decision Tree, a preamble comment, and comment appropriately 
 * throughout your code as needed for clarity, while keeping it easy to read.
 * 
 * We will be expanding on this project soon to create something a bit more interesting.
