 * Exercise 1.1 - HELLOWORLD 
 * 
 * Run this code. Can you identify any key features of the code?
 * 
 * How does this program relate to the "Toaster" Analogy?
 * 
 * What is a "class?" We will get into the details a bit later, when we reach Object Oriented Programming, but you can think of it for now as a 'single concept' 
 * (like class Bicycle, class BankAccount are two different concepts)
 * 
 * What is a "method?" A method is a set of code which is referred to by name and can be called (invoked) at any point in a program simply by utilizing the method's name. 
 * Think of it as a "bundle" of code.
 * 
 * Add the following two pieces of code  below line 33 (separately):
 * 
 * System.out.println("Hello");
 * System.out.println("World");
 * 
 * and 
 * 
 * System.out.print("Hello");
 * System.out.print("World");
 * 
 * What do you notice? the .println() function initiates a "New Line" while .print() does not.
