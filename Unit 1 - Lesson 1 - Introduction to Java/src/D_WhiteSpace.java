 * Exercise 1.4 - WHITESPACE 
 * 
 * Line 16 is difficult to read (but note that it still runs...). Fix that by adding "white space" (hitting enter)
 * 
 * Bonus - What do you think the purpose of those pesky semi-colons ";" is? Is there any benefit?
 * 
 * Now add one additional output line, stating how you feel about coding.
