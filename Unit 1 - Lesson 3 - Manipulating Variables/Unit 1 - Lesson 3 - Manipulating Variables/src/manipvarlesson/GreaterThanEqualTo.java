 * Exercise 3.6 - GREATER/LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO
 * 
 * How could we make sure we got paid at least the amount we expected in our paycheck? We could use greater than or equal to, >=, 
 * or less than or equal to, <=!
 * 
 * 1) You have been trying to complete a 30 day challenge to drink enough water per day.
 * Create a double variable called totalRecommendedAmount and set it to the product of the recommended water intake (recommendedWaterIntake) 
 * and the amount of days in the challenge (daysInChallenge).
 * 
 * 2) Create a boolean variable called isChallengeComplete and set it to the result of checking if your intake, yourWaterIntake, is at least 
 * as much as the totalRecommendedAmount. Then, print the isChallengeComplete variable.
