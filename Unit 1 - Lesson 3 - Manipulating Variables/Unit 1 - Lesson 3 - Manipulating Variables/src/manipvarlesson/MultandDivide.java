 * In main(), there is a variable called subtotal, which represents the subtotal of an amount to pay on a bill, 
 * and a variable called tax, which represents the amount of tax added to the subtotal.
 * 
 * 1) Create a double variable, total, that holds subtotal plus the product of subtotal and tax. Print the total variable.
 * 
 * 2) There were 4 people who bought this meal together and want to split the cost. Create a double variable called perPerson that holds total divided by 4.
