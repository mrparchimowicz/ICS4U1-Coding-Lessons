 * Exercise 3.9 - REVIEW (BANK ACCOUNT)
 * 
 * The Review class represents a Bank Account. let’s try building some of the bank account functionality we talked about throughout the lesson.
 * 
 * 1) First, create a new double variable called updatedBalance, and store balance with amountToWithdraw subtracted from it.
 * 
 * 2) Now, you’ve decided to split your balance evenly 3 ways and give it to your three best friends.
 * Create a double variable called amountForEachFriend that holds your updated balance divided by 3.
 * 
 * 3) Your friends each want to buy a concert ticket with the money you’ve given them. The tickets cost 250!
 * Create a boolean called canPurchaseTicket and set it equal to whether or not amountForEachFriend is at least enough to purchase a concert ticket.
 * Then, use System.out.println() to print canPurchaseTicket.
 * 
 * 4) How much money did you give your friends, anyway?
 * Use + and System.out.println() to print out:
 * I gave each friend <amountForEachFriend>...
 * with the value of amountForEachFriend where <amountForEachFriend> is.
