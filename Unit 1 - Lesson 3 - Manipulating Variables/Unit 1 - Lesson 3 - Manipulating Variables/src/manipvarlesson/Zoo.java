 * Exercise 3.8 - STRING CONCATENATION
 * 
 * The + operator, which we used for adding numbers together, can be used to "concatenate" Strings. In other words, we can use it to join two Strings together!
 * 
 * 1) In our zoo, we have a certain number of animals, stored in animals, of a certain species, stored in species.
 * Use + to make a new String variable called zooDescription. It should hold a String that looks like:
 * 
 * Our zoo has <animals> <species>s!
 * 
 * For example, if we had 5 animals that were all of the species Masai Giraffe, the String would say:
 * 
 * Our zoo has 5 Masai Giraffes!
 * 
 * 2) Print out the variable zooDescription
