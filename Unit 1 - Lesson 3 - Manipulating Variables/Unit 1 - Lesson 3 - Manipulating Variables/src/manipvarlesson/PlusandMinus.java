 * Exercise 3.1 - PLUS AND MINUS
 * 
 * Variables can be manipulated and processed prior to being output.
 * 
 * 1) Create an int variable called animalsInZoo that holds the amount of zebras plus the amount of giraffes at the zoo.
 * Then, print your animalsInZoo variable.
 * 
 * 2) Two of the zebras have been traded to a neighboring rival zoo. Subtract 2 from the number of zebras and store the result in a variable called numZebrasAfterTrade.
 * Then, print the numZebrasAfterTrade variable.
