 * Exercise 3.5 - EQUAL, NOT EQUAL
 * 
 * We can use another relational operator to do this. == will tell us if two variables are equal. Notice that the equality check is two equal signs, 
 * instead of one. One equal sign, =, is how we assign values to variables! It’s easy to mix these up, so make sure to check your code for the right 
 * number of equal signs. To check if two variables are not equal, we can use !=
 * 
 * 1) You have unearthed two unlabeled albums, record A and record B.
 * To see if these are the same album, you’re going to compare the number of songs on each one, and the total length of the albums.
 * First, create a variable called sameNumberOfSongs that stores whether the two albums have the same number of songs.
 * 
 * 2) Now, create a variable called differentLength that stores the result of checking whether the two album lengths are not the same.
