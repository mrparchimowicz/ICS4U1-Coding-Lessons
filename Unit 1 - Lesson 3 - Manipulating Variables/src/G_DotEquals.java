 * Exercise 3.7 - .EQUALS()
 * 
 * So far, we’ve only been using operations on primitive types. It doesn’t make much sense to multiply Strings, or see if one String is less than the other. 
 * But what if we had two users logging into a site, and we wanted to see if their usernames were the same? 
 * 
 * With objects, such as Strings, we can’t use the primitive equality operator. To test equality with Strings, we use a built-in method called .equals(). 
 * To use it, we call it on one String, by using ., and pass in the String to compare against in parentheses:
 * 
 * 1) We have three lines from a song in G_DotEquals.java. First, print out whether line1 and line2 are the same.
 * 
 * 2) Now, print whether line2 and line3 are equal.
