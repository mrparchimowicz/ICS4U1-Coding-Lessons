 * Exercise 3.3 - MODULO (%)
 * 
 * The modulo operator %, gives us the remainder after two numbers are divided. For example, 7 % 2 = 1 (7 divided by 2 = 3 with 1 remainder), 8 % 2 = 0 (8 divided by 2 = 4 with 0 remainder)
 * 
 * You are trying to split up 26 students into groups of 3. How many students will be left out once the groups are made?
 * 
 * Create a variable called leftOut that holds the modulo of students and 3. Then, print the variable!
