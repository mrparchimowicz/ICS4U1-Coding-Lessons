 * Exercise 3.4 - GREATER THAN, LESS THAN
 * 
 * Java has "relational operators" for numeric datatypes that make boolean comparisons. These include less than (<) and greater than (>), 
 * which help us solve a number of problems.
 * 
 * 1) Print the expression that checks if the amount of credits you have earned, creditsEarned, is greater than the number of credits you need to graduate, creditsToGraduate.
 * 
 * 2) Create a variable called creditsAfterSeminar that holds the amount of credits earned after taking a seminar, which is worth creditsOfSeminar credits. 
 * creditsAfterSeminar should be the sum of creditsEarned and creditsOfSeminar. Print out whether creditsToGraduate is greater than creditsAfterSeminar.
 *
