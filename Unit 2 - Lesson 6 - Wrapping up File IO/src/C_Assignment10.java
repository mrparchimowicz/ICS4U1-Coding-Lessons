 * Exercise 13.3 - ASSIGNMENT 10
 * 
 * NOTE - This is only for students who are completing Assignment 9 by enhancing their Map Program. Students working on the database
 * are exempt from this assignment (your assignment 9 will be weighted double the value).
 * 
 * Building off of Assignment 9, instead of importing your maps into individual files, import them into one large map file,
 * by printing the first row of each map concatenated, followed by the second row of each map concatenated, and so on.
 * 
 * You should then adjust your program accordingly so it reads and processes the map from a single large file, instead of numerous small ones.
 * 
 * HINT: Assuming you finished Assignment 9, this should be very easy to accomplish... you must simply re-think the way you have been
 * looping through the arrays.
 * 
 * HINT 2: When you are inputting from the large map file, you will need some form of String Manipulation (Lesson 10). You may want to create a 
 * system in which you use a specific character to split maps (e.g. ^^ or &^&) that you can use with the String Split function.
 * 
 * EXTENSION: Incorporate Colour (Lesson 13.4) into your World Map in some way.
