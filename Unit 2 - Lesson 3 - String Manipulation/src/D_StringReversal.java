 * Exercise 10.4 - STRING REVERSAL
 * 
 * I'm not aware of any built-in String Reversal function and so we are going to build one as follows:
 * 
 * 	A) Read the string from right to left, character by character (in a loop)
 * 	B) "Build" a reversed string, by using String concatenation (+) on an empty string, adding one 
 * 		letter at a time from the end of the string.
 * 
 * Exercise: Build a String Reversal function. Assignment 7 contains a sample solution, but I encourage 
 * you to try your best first.
 *
